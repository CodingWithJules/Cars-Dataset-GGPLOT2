## GGPLOT2 Graphics Functions 
```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=dist)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, color = "red", fill="grey80") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Stopping Distance (ft)", y = "Speed (mph)" , title = "CARS")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Speed (mph)", y = "Stopping Distance (ft)", title = "CARS")
```

## Basic Graphics Functions
```{r}
require(stats); require(graphics)
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
title(main = "Cars Data")
```

```{r}
require(stats); require(graphics)
hist(cars$dist, xlab = "Distance (ft)", ylab = "Speed (mph)", col = "Red", las = 1)
```
